## ðŸ“š Lesson 7: Virtual Bunny Pet Game - Project Preparation and System Design

### What Students Will Learn

This lesson brings together all the programming concepts students have mastered throughout the course to create an engaging Virtual Bunny Pet Game. Students will learn how to develop a complete interactive application that manages a virtual pet's well-being through player interactions and persistent data storage.

Students discover the fundamentals of game state management by tracking the bunny's hunger, happiness, and health levels over time. They'll understand how to create dynamic systems where values change based on player actions and the passage of time, requiring regular interaction to maintain optimal pet health.

The lesson emphasizes practical file handling skills as students learn to save and load the bunny's life data between game sessions. They'll implement persistent storage systems that allow the virtual pet to "remember" its state even after the program is closed and reopened, creating a truly continuous pet care experience.

Students also develop user interface design skills by creating intuitive menu systems and clear status displays. They'll learn to provide meaningful feedback to players about their pet's condition and the effects of different actions, making the game both educational and entertaining.

### Hands-On Learning

Students design and implement the complete Virtual Bunny Pet Game, starting with creating the core data structure to track the bunny's vital statistics. They'll build functions for feeding, playing, and checking the bunny's status, each affecting different aspects of the pet's well-being in realistic ways.

The project integrates file operations for persistent data storage, function definitions for organizing game features, while loops for the main game menu system, and conditional statements for managing the bunny's responses to different care actions. Students experience the joy of creating a living, breathing virtual companion that responds to their care and attention over multiple game sessions.
