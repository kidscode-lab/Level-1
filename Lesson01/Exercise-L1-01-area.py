# L1 - Exercise 02
#   Develop a program to calculate the area of a triangle

# Initialize
area = 0
base = 0
height = 0

# Process
print('Calculate area of triangle')
base = float(input('Base of the triangle:'))
height = float(input('Height of the triangle:'))

# Output
print(f'The area is: {base * height / 2}')
