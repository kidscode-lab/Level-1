## ðŸ“š Lesson 3: Advanced Loops and Program Control

### What Students Will Learn

In this lesson, students master the art of creating programs that can run continuously and respond to user choices. They'll discover the power of while loops, which allow programs to keep running until specific conditions are met, creating truly interactive applications that feel more like real software.

Students learn to compare different types of loops and understand when to use each one. While for loops are perfect for counting and processing known quantities, while loops excel at creating menus, games, and applications that need to keep running until the user decides to stop.

The lesson emphasizes building robust programs that can handle user errors gracefully. Students learn to validate input, provide helpful error messages, and create programs that don't crash when users make mistakes - essential skills for creating professional-quality software.

Through comprehensive programming challenges, students practice combining all their previous knowledge: variables, user input, conditionals, and both types of loops. They'll see how these fundamental concepts work together to create sophisticated, real-world applications.

### Hands-On Learning

The centerpiece of this lesson is building a complete birthday party planning application with budget management. Students create an interactive program that presents menus, tracks spending, maintains shopping lists, and provides real-time budget updates - demonstrating how programming concepts combine to solve practical problems.

Students will debug programs, test edge cases, and learn to think like software developers by anticipating what users might do wrong. This lesson bridges the gap between learning individual programming concepts and building complete, functional applications that could actually be useful in real life.
