## ðŸ“š Lesson 2: Decision Making and Loops

### What Students Will Learn

Building on Lesson 1's foundation, students dive into making their programs smarter and more dynamic. They'll discover how to add unpredictability to their code using random number generation, turning static programs into interactive experiences like dice simulators and lottery ticket generators.

The heart of this lesson focuses on decision-making through conditional statements. Students learn how programs can evaluate situations and choose different paths based on conditions, much like how we make decisions in real life. They'll master the if-elif-else structure that allows programs to respond intelligently to different scenarios.

Students explore logical and Boolean operators that help programs make complex decisions by combining multiple conditions. They'll understand how to compare values and create sophisticated decision trees that can handle real-world scenarios like age-based fare calculations for public transit.

The lesson culminates with an introduction to repetition through for loops and the range function. Students discover how to make programs perform tasks multiple times efficiently, eliminating the need to write repetitive code and opening the door to processing large amounts of data.

### Hands-On Learning

Students start by creating random number generators and simple guessing games that demonstrate unpredictability in programming. They'll build a comprehensive YRT (York Region Transit) fare calculator that uses complex decision-making to determine ticket prices based on passenger age groups.

The lesson includes interactive quizzes and coding challenges that test students' understanding of conditional logic. Students will combine everything they've learned to create programs that generate random numbers, make decisions about those numbers, and use loops to repeat processes multiple times - setting the foundation for more complex programming concepts.
