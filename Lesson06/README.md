## ðŸ“š Lesson 6: Game Development - Hangman Project

### What Students Will Learn

This lesson marks a significant milestone in the course as students apply everything they've learned to create their first complete game. The Hangman project serves as a comprehensive capstone that demonstrates how individual programming concepts work together to create engaging, interactive experiences.

Students learn the art of game design and development, starting with breaking down a complex project into manageable components. They'll understand how to analyze game requirements, identify necessary variables and data structures, and plan the logical flow of a complete application from start to finish.

The lesson emphasizes practical problem-solving skills as students implement game mechanics like random word selection, user input validation, guess tracking, and win/lose conditions. They'll discover how to manage game state, create user-friendly feedback systems, and handle edge cases that could break their program.

Students also gain experience with iterative development and debugging as they build their game step by step. They'll learn to test each component individually before integrating everything into a working game, developing essential software development practices that professional programmers use daily.

### Hands-On Learning

Students work through the complete development cycle of the Hangman game, starting with planning and design, then implementing each feature systematically. They'll create word lists, implement random selection, build the main game loop with proper attempt tracking, and develop the letter-guessing mechanics that make the game challenging and fun.

The project integrates file operations for storing word lists, functions for organizing code into logical modules, loops for game flow control, and conditional statements for game logic. Students experience the satisfaction of seeing all their programming skills combine into a polished, playable game that they can share with friends and family.
